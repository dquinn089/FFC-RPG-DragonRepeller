## My process

I started by creating the HTML structure and styling the game with CSS to ensure it is visually appealing and responsive. The game logic was implemented using JavaScript, focusing on managing the game state, handling user interactions, and updating the UI dynamically based on the game events.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of JavaScript, especially in managing state and handling events. I also learned how to dynamically update the DOM and use CSS to style different game states. Additionally, I improved my skills in creating a simple game loop and logic for an RPG game.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to add more features to the game such as more monster types, additional weapons, and different game endings. I also want to improve the game UI and add better CSS design to make the game more engaging. Furthermore, I aim to explore using local storage to save the game state.
